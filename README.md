# Gastric-Cancer-Prediction
Prediction of Gastric Cancer from Gene Expression Dataset Using Supervised Machine Learning Models.

The problem statement is to identify if a particular individual has Gastric cancer or not. In the case, they are found to have contracted Gastric cancer, they will be classified into one of the two types of Gastric cancer,
The three classes in the dataset are,
                1.	DIFFUSE
                2.	INTESTINAL
                3.	NORMAL

Methods:

Below mentioned are the steps involved in this data science project,
1.	Explore the data and find patterns and insights,
2.	Perform Feature selection, to find the most important features
3.	Split the prepared dataset into training set and Test set,
4.	Build the machine learning algorithms onto the dataset,
5.	Evaluate the performance of machine learning models.
